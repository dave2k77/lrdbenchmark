# Documentation Summaries

This folder previously contained detailed development summaries for the LRDBenchmark framework. All individual summary files have been consolidated into a single comprehensive document.

## Current Status

All development documentation has been consolidated into:
- **`../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`**: Comprehensive project overview and evolution document

## Purpose

The consolidated documentation serves as:
1. **Complete Project History**: Full record of development and evolution
2. **Technical Reference**: Comprehensive overview of all features and achievements
3. **User Guide**: Installation, usage, and feature documentation
4. **Research Documentation**: Scientific contributions and impact

## Note

This folder now contains only this README file. All detailed development summaries have been consolidated into the main PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md document for better organisation and accessibility.
