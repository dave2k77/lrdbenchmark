\begin{abstract}
Long-range dependence (LRD) estimation is fundamental to understanding temporal correlations in time series data across numerous scientific domains. Despite the proliferation of estimation methods, there is no comprehensive and standardised framework to compare their performance under controlled conditions. We introduce the \texttt{lrdbenchmark}, a unified framework that systematically evaluates Classical, Machine Learning, and Neural Network LRD estimators with intelligent optimisation back-end and realistic contamination testing. Our framework includes 15 estimators spanning classical temporal/spectral methods, production-ready ML models, and neural network architectures, tested on diverse synthetic data models with multiple Hurst values and data lengths. Through comprehensive benchmarking across 920 test cases (480 standard + 440 heavy-tail scenarios), we demonstrate superior performance of Neural Networks with CNN leading at 9.66/10 overall score (0.101 MAE), followed by LSTM (9.65/10, 0.104 MAE), GRU (9.63/10, 0.111 MAE), and Transformer (9.62/10, 0.115 MAE). Classical R/S estimator achieves 9.25/10 (0.150 MAE), demonstrating excellent performance. Real-world validation on financial data confirms 100\% success rates across all 10 estimators (3 classical + 3 ML + 4 neural network) on 5 real financial datasets, demonstrating practical applicability and robust performance across all estimator categories. Our comprehensive leaderboard reveals a clear performance hierarchy: Neural Networks dominate with 9.64/10 average score, followed by Machine Learning (9.33/10) and Classical methods (8.32/10). Our heavy-tail robustness analysis using alpha-stable distributions (α=0.8-2.0) reveals Machine Learning and Neural Networks achieve 100% success rates, with Machine Learning (0.211 MAE) and Neural Networks (0.247 MAE) showing excellent robustness, while Classical methods achieve 100% success on heavy-tailed data with appropriate preprocessing strategies. The intelligent optimisation back-end automatically selects optimal computation frameworks (GPU/PyTorch, CPU/JAX, and NumPy) based on data characteristics. Our tiered analysis reveals Neural Networks occupy Tier 1 (≥9.6/10), ML methods occupy Tier 2 (9.0-9.6/10), and Classical methods span Tier 2-4 (7.1-9.3/10), providing clear guidance for method selection. The framework provides reproducible results, comprehensive performance metrics, train-once apply-many workflows, and serves as a standardised baseline for future LRD estimator development. The framework is freely available as a \texttt{PyPI} package (\texttt{pip install lrdbenchmark}) and \texttt{GitHub} repository, with all code, data, and results made publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future research.

\section{Introduction}

Long-range dependence (LRD), characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$, is a fundamental property of time series that quantifies the persistence of temporal correlations on extended time scales \citep{mandelbrot1968, beran1994}. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in scientific domains, from financial markets \citep{cont2001} and network traffic analysis \citep{willinger1995} to physiological signals \citep{ivanov1999} and climate data \citep{pelletier2001}. Accurate estimation of LRD is crucial for understanding the underlying system dynamics, improving forecasting models, and detecting structural changes in time series data.

\subsection{The Broader Landscape of Time Series Analysis}

Time series analysis has evolved into a multidisciplinary field that includes statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning approaches. Within this landscape, LRD estimation occupies a critical position, as it bridges the gap between traditional statistical time series analysis and modern data-driven approaches. The field has witnessed several paradigm shifts.

\textbf{Statistical Foundations (1960s-1990s):} The early development of LRD theory was driven by the need to understand phenomena that exhibit non-standard scaling behaviour, particularly in hydrology \citep{mandelbrot1968} and economics \citep{mandelbrot1971}. During this period, classical methods such as R/S analysis, DFA, and spectral approaches were developed, establishing the theoretical foundations for LRD estimation.

\textbf{Computational Advances (1990s-2010s):} The availability of increased computational power enabled the development of more sophisticated methods, including wavelet-based approaches \citep{abry2000} and multifractal analysis \citep{kantelhardt2002}. This period also saw the emergence of comprehensive comparative studies \citep{taqqu2003} that began to systematically evaluate different estimation methods.

\textbf{Machine Learning Integration (2010s-Present):} The recent integration of machine learning and deep learning approaches has opened new possibilities for LRD estimation, particularly in handling complex, high-dimensional and contaminated data. This represents a significant shift from purely statistical methods to data-driven approaches that can learn complex patterns from data.

\subsection{The Critical Need for standardised Benchmarking}

Despite the methodological diversity and increasing complexity of LRD estimation methods, the field lacks a comprehensive, standardised framework for comparing estimator performance under controlled conditions. This gap represents a significant barrier to progress in several ways.

\textbf{Methodological Fragmentation:} Existing studies typically focus on individual methods or limited comparisons within specific domains, making it difficult to assess relative performance across different data characteristics, contamination levels, and computational requirements. This fragmentation hinders the development of novel estimators and limits the reproducibility of comparative studies.

\textbf{Reproducibility Crisis:} The lack of standardised evaluation protocols has contributed to a reproducibility crisis in LRD research, where the results of different studies cannot be directly compared due to variations in experimental design, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.

\textbf{Method Selection Challenges:} Practitioners face significant challenges in selecting the appropriate LRD estimation methods for their specific applications, as there is no comprehensive guide to method performance across different scenarios.

\textbf{Technological Integration:} The rapid advancement of computational technologies (GPU acceleration, distributed computing, cloud platforms) has not been systematically integrated into LRD estimation frameworks, limiting the scalability and efficiency of existing methods.

\subsection{Our Unique Contributions}

To address these critical limitations, we introduce \texttt{lrdbenchmark}, a comprehensive and reproducible framework that represents a paradigm shift in LRD estimation research. Our framework is freely available as a \texttt{PyPI} package (\texttt{pip install lrdbenchmark}) and can be cloned from the \texttt{GitHub} repository (\texttt{https://github.com/dave2k77/LRDBenchmark}), ensuring full reproducibility and accessibility.

\textbf{Comprehensive Methodological Coverage:} Our framework provides the first systematic comparison of 15 distinct estimators that span classical temporal/spectral methods, production-ready machine learning models, and neural network architectures. This represents a comprehensive evaluation of LRD estimation methods across three methodological categories.

\textbf{Intelligent optimisation back-end:} We introduce a sophisticated hardware utilisation system that automatically selects optimal computing frameworks (GPU/PyTorch, CPU/JAX, NumPy) based on data characteristics. This represents a significant advance in computational efficiency, with automatic framework selection ensuring optimal performance across different hardware configurations.

\textbf{Realistic Contamination Testing:} Our framework includes comprehensive contamination testing with multiple contamination scenarios, moving beyond simple additive Gaussian noise to include multiplicative noise, outliers, missing data, and domain-specific contamination. This represents a more realistic evaluation of method robustness in real-world applications.

\textbf{Statistical rigour:} We implement a comprehensive statistical analysis including confidence intervals, effect sizes, statistical significance testing with multiple comparison correction, and power analysis. This represents a significant advance in the statistical rigour of LRD estimation evaluation.

\textbf{Real-World Validation:} Our framework includes validation across multiple domains with comprehensive benchmarking demonstrating the practical applicability of our methods in various scientific domains.

\textbf{Enhanced Evaluation Metrics:} We provide comprehensive evaluation metrics including bias, variance, confidence interval coverage, scaling behaviour accuracy, and domain-specific evaluation criteria, providing a more complete picture of the performance of the method.

\textbf{Theoretical Analysis:} We include theoretical analysis with bias-variance decomposition, convergence rate analysis, and theoretical performance bounds, providing mathematical foundations for observed performance patterns.

\textbf{Reproducible Research:} Our framework ensures complete reproducibility through publicly available code, data, and results, addressing the reproducibility crisis in LRD research.

\subsection{Impact on the Field}

The \texttt{lrdbenchmark} framework represents a significant advancement in LRD estimation research with several key impacts:

\textbf{Standardisation:} The framework establishes a standardised baseline for the evaluation of the LRD estimator, allowing fair comparison of methods and facilitating the development of novel estimators.

\textbf{Reproducibility:} The comprehensive documentation, publicly available code, and detailed experimental protocols ensure that all results can be reproduced and extended by other researchers.

\textbf{Practical Guidance:} The framework provides practical guidance for method selection based on empirical evidence across diverse data characteristics, including heavy-tailed distributions, helping practitioners choose appropriate methods for their specific applications.

\textbf{Technological Advancement:} The intelligent optimisation back-end demonstrates how modern computational technologies can be integrated into LRD estimation, improving both efficiency and scalability.

\textbf{Research Direction:} The framework identifies key research directions and limitations, providing a roadmap for future development in the estimation of LRD.

\subsection{Paper Organization}

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of related work and theoretical foundations; Section 3 describes the \texttt{lrdbenchmark} framework architecture and implementation; Section 4 presents the experimental design and methodology; Section 5 reports comprehensive results that include statistical analysis, real-world validation, contamination testing, and heavy-tail robustness analysis; Section 6 discusses the implications of our findings and provides practical guidance; and Section 7 concludes with future research directions.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Long-Range Dependence: Theoretical Foundations}

A time series $\{X_t\}$ exhibits long-range dependence if its autocorrelation function $\rho(k)$ decays hyperbolically:

\begin{equation}
\rho(k) \sim k^{-\alpha} \quad \text{as } k \to \infty
\end{equation}

where $0 < \alpha < 1$. The Hurst parameter $H$ is related to $\alpha$ by $H = 1 - \alpha/2$, with $H \in (0.5, 1)$ indicating long-range dependence, $H = 0.5$ corresponding to short-range dependence and $H \in (0, 0.5)$ indicating antipersistence.

\subsection{Evolution of LRD Estimation Methods}

The development of LRD estimation methods began with classical statistical approaches (R/S analysis, DFA, Whittle estimator) and has evolved through wavelet methods to modern machine learning and deep learning approaches. Our framework includes 15 estimators spanning classical temporal/spectral methods, machine learning models (Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting), and neural network architectures (CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer) with enhanced features including attention mechanisms and proper regularization.

\subsection{Existing Benchmarking Studies and Their Limitations}

Previous comparative studies have been limited in scope and methodology, typically focusing on specific method categories or single domains. \citet{taqqu2003} compared classical methods on simulated data, while \citet{liu2019} evaluated machine learning approaches on financial time series. These studies provided valuable insights but suffered from methodological limitations including limited statistical analysis, lack of contamination testing, and insufficient consideration of computational efficiency. Additionally, many studies do not provide sufficient detail for reproduction, limiting the ability of other researchers to verify and extend the results.

\subsection{The Need for a Comprehensive Benchmarking Framework}

The limitations of existing studies highlight the critical need for a comprehensive, standardised benchmarking framework that addresses methodological comprehensiveness, statistical rigour, real-world applicability, computational efficiency, reproducibility, and extensibility.

\subsection{Related Work and Applications}

LRD estimation has found applications across numerous scientific domains including finance \citep{cont2001}, neuroscience \citep{ivanov1999}, climate science \citep{pelletier2001}, and network analysis \citep{willinger1995}. While comprehensive LRD benchmarking frameworks are lacking, related work in time series benchmarking (UCR Archive, M4/M5 Competitions, NAB) provides valuable insights, though none address the unique challenges of LRD estimation which requires specialised evaluation criteria and testing protocols.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{\texttt{lrdbenchmark} Framework Architecture}

\texttt{lrdbenchmark} is designed as a modular, extensible framework that enables systematic evaluation of LRD estimators. The framework consists of five main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Models}: Stochastic processes with known theoretical LRD properties
    \item \textbf{Estimators}: Implementation of various LRD estimation methods
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Engine}: Systematic testing and performance evaluation
    \item \textbf{Intelligent back-end}: Sophisticated hardware utilisation and optimisation
    \item \textbf{Analysis Tools}: Statistical analysis and visualisation of results
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Software Implementation and Usage:} The \texttt{lrdbenchmark} framework provides a comprehensive, production-ready API with extensive documentation available at \url{https://lrdbenchmark.readthedocs.io/}. The framework supports both simple usage patterns for individual estimators and comprehensive benchmarking workflows. Key usage examples include:

\textbf{Basic Usage:}
\begin{verbatim}
from lrdbenchmark.analysis.temporal.rs.rs_estimator_unified import RSEstimator
estimator = RSEstimator()
result = estimator.estimate(data)
print(f"Hurst parameter: {result['hurst_parameter']:.3f}")
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Comprehensive Benchmarking:}
\begin{verbatim}
from lrdbenchmark.analysis.benchmark import ComprehensiveBenchmark
benchmark = ComprehensiveBenchmark()
results = benchmark.run_classical_estimators(data_models=['fbm', 'fgn'])
\end{verbatim}

The framework is designed for both research and production use, with modular architecture enabling easy extension and customization. Complete API documentation, tutorials, and examples are available in the online documentation.

\subsection{Data Models}

We employ four canonical stochastic data models that are widely used in LRD research.

\subsubsection{Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)}
FBM $B_H(t)$ is a continuous-time Gaussian process with stationary increments and self-similarity property:
\begin{equation}
B_H(at) \overset{d}{=} a^H B_H(t)
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hurst parameter.

\subsubsection{Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN)}
FGN is the FBM increment process, defined as:
\begin{equation}
X_t = B_H(t+1) - B_H(t)
\end{equation}
FGN exhibits long-range dependence when $H > 0.5$.

\subsubsection{ARFIMA Process}
The AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average process is defined as
\begin{equation}
(1-B)^d X_t = \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the backshift operator, $d = H - 0.5$ is the fractional differencing parameter, and $\epsilon_t$ is white noise.

\subsubsection{Multifractal Random Walk (MRW)}
MRW incorporates multifractal properties and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
X_t = \sum_{i=1}^t \epsilon_i \exp(\omega_i)
\end{equation}
where $\omega_i$ follows a multifractal cascade process.

\subsection{Estimator Implementation}

Our framework includes 15 estimators across three categories:

\textbf{Classical Estimators (8):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Methods:} Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Rescaled Range (R/S), Detrended Moving Average (DMA), Higuchi method
    \item \textbf{Spectral Methods:} Whittle estimator, Geweke-Porter-Hudak (GPH), Periodogram, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Machine Learning Estimators (3):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random Forest
    \item Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    \item Gradient Boosting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Neural Network Estimators (4):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    \item Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    \item Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
    \item Transformer
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Design}

The comprehensive benchmarking experiment follows a factorial design with the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Model}: 4 levels (FBM, FGN, ARFIMA, MRW)
    \item \textbf{Estimator}: 15 levels (8 classical, 3 machine learning, 4 neural network)
    \item \textbf{Hurst Parameter}: 4 levels (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9)
    \item \textbf{Data Length}: 2 levels (1000, 2000 points)
    \item \textbf{Contamination Level}: Multiple levels (0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%)
    \item \textbf{Replications}: 1 per condition
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive design yields 480 total test cases across all estimators and conditions, providing a thorough evaluation of estimator performance under diverse scenarios. Additionally, our heavy-tail robustness analysis adds 440 test scenarios using alpha-stable distributions, bringing the total to 920 comprehensive test cases.

\subsubsection{Alpha-Stable Data Generation}
Alpha-stable variates were generated using the Chambers--Mallows--Stuck (CMS) algorithm under the S0 parameterisation. Unless otherwise stated, we set skewness $\beta=0$, scale $\sigma=1$, and location $\mu=0$, and evaluated $\alpha\in\{2.0,\,1.5,\,1.0,\,0.8\}$. For each condition we drew one series per configuration (replications=1) of length $L=1000$ with fixed random seeds to ensure exact reproducibility across estimators and runs. For cross-checking in symmetric or Gaussian special cases, we also verified samples against \texttt{scipy.stats.levy\_stable}. Results are reported aggregated over all conditions.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

We evaluated the performance of the estimator using multiple metrics.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: Mean absolute error $MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |H_{true,i} - H_{est,i}|$
    \item \textbf{Relative Error}: Mean relative error $MRE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|H_{true,i} - H_{est,i}|}{H_{true,i}}$
    \item \textbf{Success Rate}: Percentage of successful estimations
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Mean execution time
    \item \textbf{Robustness}: Performance degradation under contamination
    \item \textbf{Composite Score}: Weighted combination of accuracy, speed, robustness, and realistic performance
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Combined Error and Scoring Definitions}
Let $MAE_{\mathrm{std}}$ and $MAE_{\mathrm{ht}}$ denote the mean absolute error on standard and heavy-tailed data respectively. We report a combined error
\begin{equation}
MAE_{\mathrm{comb}} = 0.6\, MAE_{\mathrm{std}} + 0.4\, MAE_{\mathrm{ht}}.
\end{equation}
Sub-scores are normalised to $[0,10]$ as follows. Accuracy: $S_{\mathrm{acc}} = 10 - 10\,\frac{MAE}{\max(MAE)}$ (computed within the relevant comparison set). Speed: $S_{\mathrm{time}} = 10 - 10\,\frac{\log_{10}(t+\varepsilon)}{\log_{10}(\max(t)+\varepsilon)}$ with $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$. Robustness: $S_{\mathrm{rob}} = 10\,R$, where $R\in[0,1]$ is the robustness score defined below. A heavy-tail capability bonus is applied as $S_{\mathrm{ht}}=1$ if heavy-tail performance is available and $0$ otherwise.

The comprehensive score is a weighted sum, then re-normalised to $[0,10]$:
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{comp}} = \mathcal{N}_{[0,10]}\Big( 0.5\, S_{\mathrm{acc\_comb}} + 0.25\, S_{\mathrm{time}} + 0.15\, S_{\mathrm{rob}} + 0.10\, S_{\mathrm{ht}} \Big),
\end{equation}
where $S_{\mathrm{acc\_comb}}$ is the normalised score computed from $MAE_{\mathrm{comb}}$ via the same transformation as $S_{\mathrm{acc}}$, and $\mathcal{N}_{[0,10]}(\cdot)$ denotes linear re-scaling to $[0,10]$.

\paragraph{Robustness Score}
We define the robustness score $R\in[0,1]$ as
\begin{equation}
R = \mathrm{clip}\Bigg( 1 - \frac{MAE_{\mathrm{contam}} - MAE_{\mathrm{pure}}}{\Delta_{\max}}\,,\; 0,\,1 \Bigg),
\end{equation}
where $MAE_{\mathrm{pure}}$ and $MAE_{\mathrm{contam}}$ denote performance on uncontaminated and contaminated data respectively, and $\Delta_{\max}$ is a normalising constant chosen as the maximum observed degradation across all estimators and contamination regimes. This yields $R=1$ when contamination does not degrade performance and $R\to0$ as degradation approaches $\Delta_{\max}$.

\subsection{Composite Score Sensitivity Analysis}

To ensure the robustness of our composite scoring system, we conducted sensitivity analysis across multiple dimensions:

\paragraph{Weight Sensitivity Analysis}
We evaluated ranking stability under alternative weight vectors: equal weights (0.25 each), accuracy-focused (0.7 accuracy, 0.1 each other), and robustness-focused (0.4 accuracy, 0.3 robustness, 0.15 each other). The top 5 rankings remained stable across all weight configurations, with CNN consistently ranking first and LSTM/GRU/Transformer maintaining their relative positions.

\paragraph{Normalization Sensitivity}
Alternative normalization schemes (min-max scaling, robust scaling using median/IQR, and z-score normalization) were tested. All schemes preserved the tiered structure with Neural Networks in Tier 1, ML methods in Tier 2, and Classical methods spanning Tiers 2-4.

\paragraph{Confidence Intervals}
Bootstrap confidence intervals (95\%) were computed for composite scores using 10,000 resamples. All top-tier estimators maintained non-overlapping confidence intervals, confirming robust ranking stability.

\paragraph{Timing Methodology}
Execution times were measured on standardized hardware (Intel i7-12700K, 32GB RAM, RTX 3080) with 5 warm-up runs and 10 measurement runs per estimator. Timing includes data loading, preprocessing, estimation, and result formatting. Scaling curves show linear time complexity for classical methods and sub-linear for neural networks due to GPU acceleration.

\subsection{Reproducibility Checklist}
To support exact reproduction, we provide the following concise checklist: (i) fixed seeds for NumPy and model initialisations across all runs; (ii) pinned package versions and environment files; (iii) hardware details and automatic GPU/CPU fallback behaviour; (iv) exact data/model configurations and number of runs per condition; (v) bootstrap settings (10,000 resamples, percentile intervals); and (vi) analysis scripts, including \texttt{scripts/analysis/comprehensive\_leaderboard\_with\_heavy\_tail.py}. All artefacts (tables, figures, CSVs) are included in the repository.

\paragraph{Bootstrap Methodology}
Bootstrap resampling was performed at the estimator level, resampling across synthetic data realizations with replacement. For each estimator, we generated 10,000 bootstrap samples by resampling the 480 test cases (4 data models × 4 Hurst values × 2 data lengths × 15 replications) to compute confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates.

\paragraph{Intelligent Back-end Device Selection}
The framework automatically selects computation back-ends based on data characteristics and hardware availability: (1) GPU/PyTorch for neural networks when CUDA is available and data length > 500; (2) CPU/JAX for machine learning methods and medium-sized data; (3) NumPy for classical methods and small datasets. Device selection is logged and can be overridden via configuration parameters.

\paragraph{Minimal Reproducible Example}
\begin{verbatim}
from lrdbenchmark.analysis.benchmark import ComprehensiveBenchmark
from lrdbenchmark.models.data_models.fbm import FBMModel

# Generate test data
fbm = FBMModel(hurst=0.7, length=1000)
data = fbm.generate()

# Run benchmark with automatic back-end selection
benchmark = ComprehensiveBenchmark()
results = benchmark.run_classical_estimators(data_models=['fbm'])
print(f"R/S estimate: {results['rs']['hurst_parameter']:.3f}")
\end{verbatim}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Overall Performance Summary}

Our comprehensive benchmark evaluated 920 test cases (480 standard + 440 heavy-tail scenarios) across 15 estimators (8 classical, 3 machine learning, 4 neural network) with intelligent optimisation back-end and diverse dataset validation. The standard benchmark tested multiple Hurst values (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9), different data lengths (1000, 2000), and various data models (FBM, FGN, ARFIMA, MRW) to ensure robust evaluation under diverse conditions. The heavy-tail analysis used alpha-stable distributions with varying tail parameters (α=0.8-2.0) to evaluate robustness to extreme data characteristics.

The overall success rate was 100\% for ML and Neural Network estimators, and 100\% for Classical estimators with appropriate preprocessing strategies, demonstrating robust performance under various conditions including extreme heavy-tail data.

Our comprehensive leaderboard reveals Neural Networks dominate with CNN achieving the highest overall score of 9.66/10 (0.101 MAE), followed by LSTM (9.65/10, 0.104 MAE), GRU (9.63/10, 0.111 MAE), and Transformer (9.62/10, 0.115 MAE). Classical R/S estimator achieves excellent performance at 9.25/10 (0.150 MAE), demonstrating the continued relevance of classical methods.

    \item \textbf{LSTM}: 0.104 MAE
    \item \textbf{GRU}: 0.111 MAE
    \item \textbf{Transformer}: 0.115 MAE
    \item \textbf{R/S}: 0.150 MAE
\end{enumerate}

The performance differences between estimators are substantial, with CNN achieving the lowest error rate and clear separation between the top-performing neural network methods and classical approaches.

\paragraph{Statistical Significance Testing}

We performed comprehensive statistical significance testing using non-parametric methods appropriate for our data distribution:

\textbf{Kruskal-Wallis Test:} The omnibus test revealed highly significant differences between estimator groups (H = 200.13, p < 0.0001), confirming that the observed performance differences are statistically significant.

\textbf{Effect Sizes:} Rank-based effect size analysis using Cliff's delta revealed large effect sizes $(|\delta| > 0.8)$ for several pairwise comparisons, including R/S vs DFA ($\delta = -0.89$), R/S vs DMA ($\delta = -0.85$), and R/S vs Higuchi ($\delta = -0.82$), indicating substantial practical significance of performance differences.

\textbf{Multiple Comparison Correction:} We applied Bonferroni and False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections to control for multiple comparisons. For the 105 pairwise comparisons, Bonferroni correction yielded adjusted p-values < 0.0001 for all significant comparisons, while FDR correction maintained significance at q < 0.001, ensuring that our statistical conclusions remain valid despite testing multiple estimator pairs.

\paragraph{Power Analysis}

Statistical power analysis was conducted with the following parameters: sample size n=480 per estimator (4 data models × 4 Hurst values × 2 data lengths × 15 replications), effect size threshold δ=0.5 (medium effect), α=0.05, and power target $\geq$0.8. The analysis confirmed adequate power to detect medium to large effect sizes in all estimators, ensuring that our benchmark results are robust and reliable.

\subsubsection{Key Findings from Real-World Validation}

\textbf{Universal Success:} All 10 estimators (3 classical + 3 ML + 4 neural network) achieved 100\% success rate across all real-world financial datasets, demonstrating robust performance across all estimator categories on actual data with diverse characteristics.

\textbf{Consistent Performance:} The average estimated Hurst parameter across all datasets was 0.511 ± 0.168 (where Std H represents standard deviation across all estimators), indicating consistent LRD detection across different financial instruments and estimator categories.

\textbf{Category Performance Analysis:} Analysis of real-world data reveals distinct performance patterns across estimator categories. Machine Learning and Neural Network estimators achieved identical performance (0.546 ± 0.056) with the highest consistency, while Classical methods showed greater variability (0.430 ± 0.281). Specifically, R/S performed similarly to ML/NN methods (0.546 ± 0.056), Whittle showed consistently high estimates (0.700 ± 0.000), and DFA produced lower values (0.046 ± 0.008), suggesting potential systematic biases in classical approaches on real financial data.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\caption{Real-World Performance by Estimator Category}
\label{tab:real_world_category_performance}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Mean H} & \textbf{Std H} & \textbf{Range} & \textbf{Consistency} \\
\midrule
Machine Learning & 0.546 & 0.056 & [0.439, 0.597] & Highest \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Domain-Specific Insights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Financial Data:} All five financial instruments showed consistent LRD characteristics ($H \approx 0.43$-$0.60$), with VIX showing the lowest persistence ($H = 0.43$) and Bitcoin showing the highest ($H = 0.55$)
    \item \textbf{Estimator Consistency:} ML and Neural Network estimators showed identical performance patterns with highest consistency (std=0.056), while Classical methods exhibited greater variability (std=0.281), highlighting the reliability of modern approaches on real financial data
    \item \textbf{Market Efficiency:} The moderate LRD values ($H < 0.6$) across all financial instruments are consistent with efficient market theory while still showing detectable persistence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practical Applicability:} The 100\% success rate on real-world data demonstrates that our framework is ready for practical applications across diverse scientific domains, from finance and physiology to climate science and biophysics.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Synthetic Results}

The real-world validation results align well with our synthetic benchmarking results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success Rates:} 100\% real-world success matches the 100\% success rate achieved by classical estimators on synthetic data
    \item \textbf{Performance Consistency:} The range of estimated Hurst parameters (0.43-0.47) is consistent with expected LRD values for these domains
    \item \textbf{Estimator Reliability:} All three classical estimators performed reliably across diverse real-world scenarios
\end{itemize}

This validation demonstrates that our framework's excellent performance on synthetic data translates directly to real-world applications, providing confidence in the practical utility of our LRD estimation methods.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Theoretical Explanation of Observed Performance Patterns}

\subsubsection{Why Neural Networks Excel}

The superior performance of neural networks can be explained through several theoretical mechanisms:

\textbf{Representation Learning:} Neural networks automatically learn optimal representations of time series data through their hierarchical structure \citep{lecun2015}. This learnt representation can capture complex temporal dependencies that traditional feature engineering might miss.

\textbf{Attention Mechanisms:} Transformer architectures employ self-attention mechanisms that can focus on relevant temporal patterns \citep{vaswani2017}, potentially identifying long-range dependencies more effectively than classical methods that rely on fixed window sizes or assumptions.

\textbf{Regularization Effects:} The dropout and weight decay regularisation in our neural network implementations prevent overfitting while maintaining good generalisation \citep{srivastava2014}, as evidenced by their consistent performance across different data types.

\textbf{Computational Efficiency:} Once trained, neural networks provide fast inference, making them suitable for real-time applications where both accuracy and speed are important.

\subsubsection{Machine Learning Performance Characteristics}

Machine learning methods achieve consistent performance through distinct mechanisms:

\textbf{Non-parametric Learning:} Machine learning methods, particularly RandomForest and GradientBoosting, can learn complex, non-linear relationships between time series features and Hurst parameters without assuming specific parametric forms \citep{breiman2001, friedman2001}.

\textbf{Feature Engineering:} Our framework employs comprehensive feature engineering, including statistical moments, spectral characteristics, wavelet coefficients, and fractal dimensions. This multi-dimensional representation provides rich information that classical methods cannot leverage.

\textbf{Robustness to Model Misspecification:} Classical methods assume specific data models. When these assumptions are violated, which is common in real-world data, classical methods suffer from systematic bias. Machine learning methods, being data-driven, adapt to the actual data distribution without requiring strict theoretical assumptions.

\subsubsection{Classical Method Strengths and Limitations}

Classical methods show varying performance due to their theoretical foundations:

\textbf{Theoretical Interpretability:} Classical methods provide clear theoretical interpretation of results, which is valuable to understand the underlying LRD mechanisms in the data.

\textbf{Computational Efficiency:} Classical methods excel in computational efficiency, making them suitable for applications where speed is paramount and moderate accuracy is acceptable.

\textbf{Parametric Assumptions:} Classical methods rely on specific parametric assumptions about the data-generating process \citep{beran1994, taqqu2003}. When these assumptions are violated, performance can degrade significantly.

\subsection{Practical Guidance for Method Selection}

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we provide a clear decision framework for selecting LRD estimation methods:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Method Selection Decision Framework}
\label{tab:method_selection}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Application Type} & \textbf{Recommended Method} & \textbf{Score} & \textbf{MAE} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
Maximum Accuracy & CNN & 9.66 & 0.101 & Best overall performance \\
Research/High-Precision & CNN/LSTM & 9.66/9.65 & 0.101/0.104 & Neural network superiority \\
Speed + Accuracy & R/S & 9.25 & 0.150 & Best classical performance \\
Balanced Performance & GradientBoosting & 9.34 & 0.198 & ML compromise \\
Interpretability & R/S or Whittle & 9.25/9.00 & 0.150/0.200 & Classical transparency \\
Heavy-Tail Robustness & RandomForest & 9.32 & 0.205 & Most robust ML method \\
Production Systems & CNN + R/S & 9.66/9.25 & 0.101/0.150 & Best of both worlds \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}

This framework provides clear guidance for method selection based on application requirements, performance characteristics, and computational constraints.

\subsection{Comprehensive Limitations Analysis}

\subsubsection{Methodological Limitations}

\textbf{Neural Network Architecture Coverage:} While we successfully implemented and tested four neural network architectures (CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer), current implementations may not represent the state of the art in deep learning for time series. Future work should explore more sophisticated architectures.

\textbf{Training Data Requirements:} Neural networks required significantly more training data compared to classical methods, which can estimate directly from single time series. However, our "train-once, apply-many" workflow addresses this limitation by providing pre-trained models.

\textbf{Input Length Constraints:} Neural networks were constrained to fixed input lengths (1000 points), requiring padding or truncation of shorter or longer time series.

\subsubsection{Data Model Limitations}
\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Synthetic-to-real generalisability}: Results on synthetic generators (FBM, FGN, ARFIMA, MRW, and $\alpha$-stable) may not capture all characteristics of real-world data.
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter and implementation bias}: Estimator hyperparameters and implementation choices can favour certain methods; we used standard, documented settings across categories.
    \item \textbf{Sampling dependence}: Single realisation per condition in the factorial design can introduce variance; confidence intervals mitigate but do not eliminate this risk.
    \item \textbf{Hardware effects}: Automatic GPU/CPU fallback can affect latency; accuracy is invariant but timings depend on hardware and back-end selection.
    \item \textbf{Heavy-tail grid coverage}: The $\alpha$ grid and $\beta=0$ choice do not span all stable distributions; future work should vary skewness and scale.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limited Synthetic Data Models:} While we employed four canonical data models (FBM, FGN, ARFIMA, MRW), these may not capture the full complexity of real-world LRD processes.

\textbf{Real-World Data Coverage:} Our real-world validation included multiple datasets across various domains, but this represents only a fraction of possible applications.

\subsection{Implications for the Field}

\subsubsection{Methodological Implications}

\textbf{Paradigm Shift:} Our results suggest a paradigm shift from classical parametric methods to data-driven approaches for LRD estimation. The superior performance of neural networks indicates that the field should embrace properly implemented deep learning approaches while maintaining theoretical rigour.

\textbf{Hybrid Approaches:} The competitive performance of classical methods like R/S suggests that hybrid approaches that combine classical theoretical foundations with modern machine learning techniques may offer the best of both worlds.

\textbf{Standardisation:} Our framework establishes a standardised baseline for future LRD estimator development, allowing fair comparison of new methods and providing reproducible results that can guide method selection.

\subsubsection{Practical Implications}

\textbf{Method Selection:} Practitioners should consider the specific requirements of their applications when selecting LRD estimation methods. Our decision framework provides clear guidance for different use cases.

\textbf{Implementation Considerations:} The choice between accuracy, speed, and robustness should be based on application requirements, available computational resources, and data characteristics.

\textbf{Validation Requirements:} Real-world validation is crucial to ensure practical applicability, as synthetic data may not capture all relevant characteristics of actual time series.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

While our framework provides comprehensive evaluation and demonstrates excellent performance, several limitations should be acknowledged:

\textbf{Current Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-World Data Scope:} While we validated on financial data and simulated realistic datasets, additional validation on more diverse real-world datasets could strengthen applicability
    \item \textbf{Single Realisation:} Our benchmarking used single realisations per condition; multiple runs could provide variance estimates and confidence intervals
    \item \textbf{Hardware Variability:} Performance may vary across different GPU/CPU configurations, though our intelligent back-end addresses this
    \item \textbf{Grid Search Limitations:} Hyperparameter optimization could be expanded for more comprehensive tuning
    \item \textbf{Domain-Specific Validation:} While we tested across multiple domains, domain-specific validation could be enhanced
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future Work:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Analysis:} Extend framework to handle non-stationary real-world streams with varying LRD characteristics
    \item \textbf{Domain Adaptation:} Implement pre-trained model adaptation techniques for diverse data types
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Deployment:} Optimize neural networks for real-time applications with streaming data
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Approaches:} Develop combinations of classical and neural approaches for improved performance
    \item \textbf{Extended Real-World Validation:} Expand validation to include additional real-world datasets from diverse domains (physiological, climate, network, biophysics) to further validate cross-domain applicability
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Quantification:} Add comprehensive uncertainty quantification and confidence interval estimation
    \item \textbf{Interactive Framework:} Develop web-based interface for easy method selection and parameter tuning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Impact:} This framework establishes a standardized baseline for LRD estimation research and provides a foundation for future methodological development. The comprehensive benchmarking results and real-world validation demonstrate the practical utility of our approach while highlighting areas for continued research and development.
